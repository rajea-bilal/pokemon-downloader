## Lessons

- Its okay to feel a little overwhelmed at the start of a challenging project. I turned this overwhelm into curosity by digging into docs, code examples and tutorials to make myself familiar with the concept and functionality of the code I was using.
- I realised that by keeping at the project, I was eventually able to make breakthroughs. 
- Understood the importance of console.log and reading errors.
- I got to see how modularizing the application helps with keeping the code organized and easy to make changes to. 
- I implemented quite a few functions in this app and it was alot of fun connecting them together to power this app.
- The joy of building something from scratch and bringing it to life was priceless for me :)
